They claim from personal experience that consumers should not smoke cannabis from this brand, as the company will knowingly sell contaminated cannabis to customers without concern for their safety. Specific accusations are made about Jushi's grow facility in Lakeville, Massachusetts, stating it is inundated with black mold. They allege Jushi uses auto-cure machines and green vault batchers that remain dirty from constantly running moldy and contaminated cannabis strains. The only way they pass lab tests is by using machines like "The Box" or "Yofumo" to sterilize just the samples being tested, while the untreated bulk product gets sold under names like "The Bank" brand, often through the dispensary Nature's Remedy. Unfortunately, the person states that NEA (Northeast Alternatives) shares the other side of that same grow facility, and within months of moving in, NEA dealt with an outbreak of hop latent viroid (HLV) and had to cull 5 flower rooms, which the person believes was caused by sharing space with the contaminated Jushi side of the facility </td>

That's a given, it's a third party rewards/analytics system. But this screams insecure to me, and could be the culprit if someone decided to abuse it.</td>

The Eleven brand of vape cartridges allegedly uses 3-year-old trim and adds artificial terpenes while claiming they are from specific strains. The Eleven cart hardware is reported to be of poor quality, leaking into the mouthpiece. There have been major mold issues with Ethos' "Natural Selections" brand products. Managers lack knowledge about cannabis and often provide inaccurate information to customers. Employees are treated as "replaceable robots," with harsh punishment for minor issues like car troubles or illness. There is a "cutthroat" atmosphere, with constant policy changes, lack of job security, and gossip/information-sharing about employees. Mental health issues are not accommodated, leading to many employees leaving or being fired. Shockingly, one employee even had a seizure at the facility. There have been incidents of rats, lights being left on for days ruining product, and improper cleaning/maintenance. Expired or nearly expired Eleven brand products are allegedly still packaged and sold.</td>
