The Eleven brand of vape cartridges allegedly uses 3-year-old trim and adds artificial terpenes while claiming they are from specific strains. The Eleven cart hardware is reported to be of poor quality, leaking into the mouthpiece. There have been major mold issues with Ethos' "Natural Selections" brand products. Managers lack knowledge about cannabis and often provide inaccurate information to customers. Employees are treated as "replaceable robots," with harsh punishment for minor issues like car troubles or illness. There is a "cutthroat" atmosphere, with constant policy changes, lack of job security, and gossip/information-sharing about employees. Mental health issues are not accommodated, leading to many employees leaving or being fired. Shockingly, one employee even had a seizure at the facility. There have been incidents of rats, lights being left on for days ruining product, and improper cleaning/maintenance. Expired or nearly expired Eleven brand products are allegedly still packaged and sold.</td>
