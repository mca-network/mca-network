    &#9432; A concerned whistleblower has revealed alarming issues with the brands "Matter" and "Livwell" produced by Verilife. They claim that their products contain dangerous qualities such as mold, mildew, and other plant diseases. The plants are not properly flushed, and nutrients are still being fed until the harvest. Furthermore, the facility lacks proper cleaning standards, and there are constant leaks from air units, leading to the development of black mold near flowering plants. Dead bugs and various pests are also reported to be included in sent out product.

      <p align="center">Our platform emerges in response to critical issues plaguing the cannabis industry in Massachusetts, revealed through leaked information, undisclosed practices, and consumer-submitted data. An in-state testing lab openly defied compliance with a new potency testing bulletin, citing a lack of enforcement by the Cannabis Control Commission (CCC). This revelation sheds light on potential abuse within the testing process, including manipulated sample submissions. Recent consumer retests expose manipulation of THC content and contamination levels, showcasing systemic issues in testing practices. Additionally, a leaked list of debts owed by numerous cannabis companies underscores financial instability within the industry.
